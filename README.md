# post-processing
Post processing script for ffmpeg encoding or converison.
This is intially written for Plex and TVheadend DVR recording in Synology NAS DS1517+ or DS918+.

Default raw recording container (.ts) will be converted to mp4 container (.mp4) with AAC audio codec for direct streaming to most recent web browser (chrome, firefox, and edge).

It is also aviailable to 1080p or 720p using libx264 but it need more powerful CPU horsepower.
Synology NAS with Quadcore CPU can do this but it takes lots of time and your patience.
